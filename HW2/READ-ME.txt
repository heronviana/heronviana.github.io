This is my first assignment using html and css. I used ATOM.
This web page shows a bit about myself and my assignments.

Validations:
CSS validated and worked. 
Markup Validation takes a while on W3C and then i get a "read timeout" and it stops, however
i was able to validade on https://validator.nu/ and it worked out.
