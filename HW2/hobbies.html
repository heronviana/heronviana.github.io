              <p>During the summer, I enjoy doing outdoor activites. I usually
              go camping, hiking, to the beach, kayaking and other activities.
              <br><br><br>
              Over the winter I like skiing at the White Mountains, Wachussets and up north in Maine and Vermont.
              I also ice skate with friends.
